A collection of games I have created.

//DUCK BATTLE//
The Duck Battle has to be played with a plugged in (xbox) controller. The game was made for my 1920x1080 resolution screen.

The red player is controlled by w,a,s,d while the green player is controlled by the arrow keys.

The blue player is controlled by the left joystick while the yellow player is controlled by the right joystick.

The goal of the game is to survive longer than the other three players. Similar to Undertale, touching a white object will hurt you.

The menu can be traversed by using left and right to choose an option, up to select, and down to deselect. Once every player has chosen, a random playerâ€™s choice will be the menu option that is actually selected.
